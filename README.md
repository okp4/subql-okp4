## Install

### Prerequisites

Be sure to have the following properly installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ru/) `v16.19` ([gallium](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.19.0/))
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) `v1.22.17`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Install the SubQuery CLI and Project Dependencies

Install SubQuery CLI globally on your terminal by using NPM (we don't recommend using Yarn to install global dependencies):

```
npm install -g @subql/cli
```

Under the project directory, install the node dependencies by running the following command ([Learn more](https://academy.subquery.network/build/install.html#)):

```
yarn OR npm install
```

## Configure the Project Further

If you want to change your project you will need to work on the following files:

- The Manifest in `project.yaml` to **configure your project**
- The GraphQL Schema in `schema.graphql` to **define shape of the data**
- The Mapping functions in `src/mappings/` directory to **transform data coming from blockchain**

[Learn more](https://academy.subquery.network/build/introduction.html)

## Build the Project

#### 1. Generate Associated Typescript

We will generate the defined entity models with the following command:

```
yarn codegen OR npm run-script codegen
```

If you change any data in your `schema.graphql`, you should run this command again. You should also consider deleting your local database in the `.data/` directory.

#### 2. Build the project

This builds your project into static files within the `/dist` for running.

```
yarn build OR npm run-script codegen
```

If you change any data in your `src/mappings/` directory you should run this command again.

## Indexing and Query

#### 1. Run Docker

Under the project directory run following command:

```
yarn start:docker
```

This will download packages from Docker, create a new Postgres database, and start an indexing an query service. When you first run this, it may take some time to start, please be patient.

#### 2. Query this Project

Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

Finally, you should see a GraphQL playground is showing in the explorer and the schemas that ready to query. On the right hand side is a documentation button that shows you what models you have to construct queries.

With this project can try to query with the following code to get a taste of how it works.

```graphql
{
  query {
    transferEvents(first: 5) {
      nodes {
        id
        blockHeight
        txHash
        recipient
        sender
        amount
      }
    }
    messages(first: 5) {
      nodes {
        id
        blockHeight
        txHash
        from
        to
        amount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
